## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Reddit API credentials (optional but recommended)
- Internet connection

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
2. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download NLTK data** (will be done automatically on first run):
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
   nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
   ```

## üîß Setup

### Option 1: Using Reddit API (Recommended)

1. **Create a Reddit App:**
   - Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
   - Click "Create App" or "Create Another App"
   - Choose "script" as the app type
   - Note down your `client_id` and `client_secret`

2. **Configure API credentials:**
   - Edit `reddit_config.json` with your credentials:
   ```json
   {
       "client_id": "your_client_id_here",
       "client_secret": "your_client_secret_here",
       "user_agent": "PersonaGenerator/1.0 by YourUsername",
       "username": "your_reddit_username",
       "password": "your_reddit_password"
   }
   ```

### Option 2: Web Scraping Only

If you don't have Reddit API credentials, the script will automatically fall back to web scraping mode.

```

### Command Line Arguments

- `user_url`: Reddit user profile URL (required)
- `--config`: Path to Reddit API configuration file (optional)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Collection Methods

1. **Reddit API (PRAW)**:
   - Retrieves up to 100 most recent submissions
   - Retrieves up to 200 most recent comments
   - Includes metadata like scores, timestamps, subreddits

2. **Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup)**:
   - Fallback method when API is unavailable
   - Scrapes user profile pages
   - Extracts post titles, comments, and basic metadata

### Analysis Components

1. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - TextBlob for polarity and subjectivity
   - NLTK VADER for compound sentiment scoring

2. **Topic Extraction**:
   - NLTK tokenization and POS tagging
   - Frequency analysis of nouns and topics

3. **Personality Inference**:
   - Activity level analysis
   - Sentiment-based trait estimation
   - Communication pattern analysis

### Citation Generation

- Automatically finds posts/comments that support each persona characteristic
- Provides confidence levels based on evidence quantity
- Includes direct links to original Reddit content

## üö® Important Notes

### Rate Limiting
- The script implements rate limiting to respect Reddit's API guidelines
- Web scraping includes delays between requests
- Large profiles may take several minutes to process

### Privacy and Ethics
- Only processes publicly available Reddit data
- Respects Reddit's terms of service
- Users should obtain proper permissions before analyzing others' profiles

### Limitations
- Analysis quality depends on available post history
- Web scraping may be less comprehensive than API access
- Personality traits are inferred, not definitively measured

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Could not extract username from URL"**
   - Ensure the URL is in the format: `https://www.reddit.com/user/username`
   - Try both `/user/` and `/u/` formats

2. **"Reddit API not available"**
   - Check your `reddit_config.json` file
   - Verify your Reddit API credentials
   - The script will fall back to web scraping

3. **"Could not extract data for user"**
   - User profile might be private or deleted
   - Try a different user profile
   - Check internet connection

4. **NLTK download errors**
   - Run the script once to automatically download required NLTK data
   - Manually download: `python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('all')"`

### Performance Tips

- Use Reddit API credentials for better data quality
- Process users with substantial post history for better personas
- Run the script in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts

## üìö Dependencies

- **praw**: Reddit API wrapper
- **requests**: HTTP library for web scraping
- **beautifulsoup4**: HTML parsing
- **nltk**: Natural language processing
- **textblob**: Sentiment analysis
- **pandas**: Data manipulation
- **numpy**: Numerical operations
